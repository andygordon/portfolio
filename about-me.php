<div class="container">
	<h2>My Name: Andrew<span>Gordon</span></h2>
	<p>
		I am a graphic designer/front end web developer bassed in London. Currently i am employed full time by West One Technology
	</p>
	<h2>Interests:</h2>
	<p>
		I have a keen interest in photography and video. With this as a side project and part of my current employment, I have sought out ways to learn how to understand lighting and composition. I frequently use Adobe Lightroom for photo organisation and editing, and Photoshop for creating my final edits. I have a strong understanding of Adobe Photoshop from CS3 to the latest CC Collection.
	</p>
	<p>
		I am the web administrator for a national Charity for which I have personally created and designed the web pages and graphics using a number of different tools. Alongside this I have also produced business cards and designed logos for several companies.
		The web pages I create are developed with CSS 3, HTML5 and PHP, along side frameworks such as Bootstrap and preprocessors LESS and SASS. Photoshop and Illustrator were used to create the designs.
	</p>
	<p>
		While at university I also trained in video filming techniques, storyboarding, editing and compositing and I have applied these skills in both professional and non-professional environments, including the Parkour Alliance, Leicester Parkour Association and for personal videos for Parkour practitioners throughout the country.
	</p>
	<h2>Spare Time:</h2>
	<p>
		In my spare time I train Parkour, Cycle and am a keen drummer to keep my fitness up and to keep my eyes open for creativity with spaces around me. I am also a voluntary PA technician on sound desks for large conferences.
